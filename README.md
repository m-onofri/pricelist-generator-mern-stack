# Pricelist Generator MERN Stack

In this project I created an application that was able to create price quotation for hotel reservations.
This is a personal progect and it's made with **Mongo DB**, **Express**, **React** and **Node.js** (**MERN stack**).


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/pricelist-generator-mern-stack.git
```

Install the packages:
```
cd pricelist-generator-mern-stack
npm install
```
Then:
```
cd client
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
cd ..
npm run dev
```

In your browser, go to http://localhost:3000/, and use the app.


## ...or watch it live!

You can play the game [here](https://pricelist-generator.herokuapp.com/).


## Main Features
* This is a fully responsive app.
* User must sign in and/or log in to use the app.
* User can create and update custom price lists.
* User can use these price lists to prepare price quotation for hotel reservation. 


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
